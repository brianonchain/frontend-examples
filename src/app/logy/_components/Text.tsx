        logy is a nexus of connection, where Asia’s living cultures and timeless wisdom interweave. Our cuisine celebrates Asian diversity through the lens of our Japanese and
        Taiwanese heritage. We create new culinary experiences by respectfully combining ingredients, techniques, and traditions inherited from each culture.

      <p>
        We chose logy to express Asia’s profound dynamism. Our cuisine unites the elements we hold sacred - nature, climate, humanity, faith and food traditions - but defies
        categorization.

        From our humble origins in a Taipei alley, our story begins anew in 2025. We continue our pursuit of excellence, creating an intimate space where the art of gastronomy and
        cherished moments transcend time.
